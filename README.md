# compare_mat_rank

process_file: convert zt/mpf content into a dict with material name as key and their rank as value.\n
to use either kind of embedding, comment out the other type.\n
to calculate correlation of either rank (zt/mpf) and rank from embedding, use zt_rank or pf_rank and comment out the other type.\n
current result: \n
output embedding: zt: 0.32, mpf: 0.53\n
word embedding: zt: 0.41, mpf: 0.58\n
